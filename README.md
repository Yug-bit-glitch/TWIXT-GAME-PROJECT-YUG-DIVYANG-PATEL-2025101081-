# TWIXT-GAME-PROJECT-YUG-DIVYANG-PATEL-2025101081-
THE STRUCTURE OF PROJECT ADOPTED BY ME;
1)CONTROL.C-FILE THAT CONTROLS GAME PLAY
2)BOARD.C-PRINTS THE BOARD,CHECKS THE VALIDITY OF MOVE
FOR NOW VALIDITY IS LIMITED TO THE THING THAT THE POINT CAN BE PLACED ON AN EMPTY CELL AND WITHIN THE LIMITS OF GRID 
THE FURTHER IMPLEMENTATION IN PHASE 2
3)TWIXT.H-THE HEADER FILE 
4)MAKE FILE 
FOR NOW IF PEG IS POSSIBLE IT WILL BE PRINTED 
PLAYERS ASSUMED TO BE A AND B USER NEEDS TO ADD COMMANDS (INTEGER CODED)
The option 2 to restore the game will be included in phase two when a log.txt will store all this 

PHASE 2 PLAN 
THE PEG CONNECTION TO BE INCORPORATED.
THE INTERSECTED LINE SEGMENT OF TWO PLAYERS PREVENTED 
THE WINNING CONDITION TO BE INCLUDED
THE GUI TO BE IMPROVED
